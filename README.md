# MonthComparison

## Description
This Java project defines a `Month` class that represents a month by its number (1-12) and provides information such as the month's name and season. The program allows you to create `Month` objects, compare them for equality, and print detailed information about the month. It demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts such as constructors, getters, setters, conditionals, and the `equals` method in Java.
